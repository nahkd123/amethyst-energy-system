# Amethyst Energy System (AES)
_(Not to be confused with symmetrical encryption algorithm)_

The main idea of this mod is to provide amethyst more usage, but you can also choose to branch out to amethyst tools from iron tools instead of going for diamond (and netherite) stuffs. The issue is: you have to find modules for your precious sword.

## Amethyst Workbench
An universal workbench for everything related to AES.

## Item Modules
- Featherweight: Make your tool lighter (a.k.a increase attack speed).
- Magic Durability: Redirect durability usage to energy module. If you ran out of energy, it will do nothing.
- Energy Module: Stores Amethyst Energy (AE). Each Amethyst Shard provides 1 AE.
- Glowing Blade (partially implemented): An attempt to mimic a sword from the hit game about the legend. I guess you already know what game that is.
- Soulstealer: Do Purpris'h Challenges to upgrade this module. Obviously you must have this module installed in your hoe in order to do challenges.
- _And more in the future!_

## TODOs
- [ ] Module texture overlay thingy.
