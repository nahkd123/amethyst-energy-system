# Amethyst Energy System (AES)
_(Not to be confused with symmetrical encryption algorithm)_

The main idea of this mod is to provide amethyst more usage, but you can also choose to branch out to amethyst tools from iron tools instead of going for diamond (and netherite) stuffs. The issue is: you have to find modules for your precious sword.

## Download and install AES
> **Note**: You need Fabric Loader 0.14.21+ for Minecraft 1.20.1 and Fabric API 0.83.0+.

Development version of AES is available for download [here](https://github.com/nahkd123/amethyst-energy-system/actions). Simply click on the top one, scroll down to "Artifacts" section and download "Artifacts". After that, extract artifacts and copy ``amethyst-energy-system.jar`` (not the one with ``-sources``!) to your ``mods/`` folder.

## Amethyst Workbench
An universal workbench for everything related to AES.

## Item Modules
- Featherweight: Make your tool lighter (a.k.a increase attack speed).
- Magic Durability: Redirect durability usage to energy module. If you ran out of energy, it will do nothing.
- Matter Condenser Vial: Charge it to 100% and use it to upgrade modules' quality.
- Energy Module: Stores Amethyst Energy (AE). Each Amethyst Shard provides 1 AE.
- Glowing Blade (partially implemented): An attempt to mimic a sword from the hit game about the legend. I guess you already know what game that is.
- Soulstealer: Do Purpris'h Challenges to upgrade this module. Obviously you must have this module installed in your hoe in order to do challenges.
- Drill: Mine blocks faster. Can be applied to shovels, axes and pickaxes.
- _And more in the future!_

## TODOs
- [ ] Module texture overlay thingy.
- [ ] Module Package: Open the package to get random module (a.k.a loot boxes but for modules).
